# AREA COLOR PALETTE (Watercolor Map)

Each Area uses a dominant watercolor pigment.  
Variation, bleed, pooling, and edge darkening are assumed.  
Related Areas share hue families but never identical colors.

---

## Forest
**Deep Sap Green**  
Cool, saturated green with blue undertone. Dense biomass and concealment.

## Old-Growth Forest
**Blue-Black Evergreen**  
Forest green washed with indigo. Heavy, ancient, light-absorbing.

## Hills
**Olive Green**  
Muted green with yellow-brown undertone. Transitional, defensible terrain.

## Wooded Hills
**Olive → Sap Green Gradient**  
Hill tones bleeding into forest green. Mixed elevation and cover.

## Foothills
**Dusty Umber**  
Brown with faint green undertone. Dry, stony, unsettled ground.

## Grassland
**Green → Yellow Wash**  
Spring green bleeding into wheat yellow. Open, productive, exposed.

## Meadow / Clearing
**Lime Green**  
Bright, optimistic green. Immediately readable as usable, open land.

## Farmland
**Golden Yellow → Rust Red**  
Harvest gold with worked-soil warmth. Human intent and labor.

## Orchard / Grove
**Yellow-Green with Orange Speckle**  
Cultivated green with warm fruit tones. Intentional but living land.

## Scrubland
**Pale Khaki**  
Low-saturation beige-green. Sparse, marginal, resilient terrain.

## Moor / Heath
**Purple-Grey**  
Cold, desaturated heather tones. Wind-scoured, poor soil.

## Marsh
**Sick Green with Brown Bleed**  
Uneven green muddied by tannin browns. Unstable, hazardous ground.

## Bog / Fen
**Near-Black Green**  
Very dark green with blue-black pooling. Heavy, deep, suffocating.

## Wet Lowlands
**Grey-Green**  
Foggy, muted green. Damp land without overt danger.

## Floodplain
**Pale Yellow with Blue Ghosting**  
Light fertile yellow with faint blue bleed. Seasonal water influence.

## Lake
**Deep Blue → Teal Gradient**  
Calm blue core darkening at edges. Strong visual gravity on the map.

## Burn Scar / Blighted Patch
**Charcoal Grey with Rust Red**  
Ash tones with angry warmth. Past violence, corruption, or catastrophe.

## Dry Flats / Hardpan
**Cracked Tan**  
Pale earth tones, low saturation. Heat-baked, reflective, unforgiving.

## Palette Design Notes

- No two Areas share the same dominant color.
- Related Areas live in the same hue family, not the same hue.
- Warm colors suggest human effort, risk, or loss.
- Cool and dark colors suggest age, danger, or depth.
- Bright colors suggest opportunity, safety, or potential.
- Emotional readability is prioritized over cartographic accuracy.

NANA BANANA PROMPT

TERRAIN TYPE = Old-Growth Forest
COLOR THEME = Blue-Black Evergreen - Forest green washed with indigo. Heavy, ancient, light-absorbing.
PERCENTAGE = 50%

Create 8 hand-painted, high resolution fantasy hex tiles (point-side up) depicting [[TERRAIN TYPE]].

USE THE PROVIDED IMAGE(S) AS A VISUAL REFERENCE. Use the established style and borders EXACTLY..

Use a [[COLOR THEME]] as the background wash for this set.

Background:
Traditional watercolor on textured cold-press paper with visible paper grain, uneven pigment pooling, soft washes, and slight color bleeding. Fill the entire hex with watercolor texture.

Foreground:
Ink illustration only. VERY thick, hand-drawn black linework with imperfect, organic edges. 
No clean vectors. No color used in the ink work. Avoid details. Make sure that the terrain is the focus. Any additional features accent the terrain and should never be a distraction from the terrain.
Pan the camera way back to show the terrain on the near horizon starting from the bottom of the hex.
Foreground elements should not extend above [[PERCENTAGE]] of the tile’s vertical height.

Composition:
Top-down tabletop map tiles, centered composition, isolated on a white background.
Natural, muted earth tones with subtle variation between tiles.

Borders:
Thick, hand-drawn black hex borders with visible variation and irregularity. Use the borders in the image as a reference point and vary the irregularity of the lines, as if each one was hand-drawn.

Style:
Vintage fantasy cartography aesthetic. Storybook map illustration. Old-school tabletop RPG feel. Highly tactile, human-made, imperfect, and painterly.

Constraints:
No text. No labels. No UI elements. No symbols outside the hex.
